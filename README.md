# Pattern Lab Node Core

This repository contains the core functionality for Pattern Lab Node. Pattern Lab helps you and your team build thoughtful, pattern-driven user interfaces using atomic design principles.

## Support for Pattern Lab Node

Pattern Lab Node wouldn't be what it is today without the support of the community. It will always be free and open source. Continued development is made possible in part from the support of [these wonderful project supporters](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Thanks). If you want to learn more about supporting the project, visit the [Pattern Lab Node Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/patternlab).

## Installation

Pattern Lab Node can be used different ways. Editions are **example** pairings of Pattern Lab code and do not always have an upgrade path or simple means to run as a dependency within a larger project. Users wishing to be most current and have the greatest flexibility are encouraged to consume `patternlab-node` directly. Users wanting to learn more about Pattern Lab and have a tailored default experience are encouraged to start with an Edition. Both methods still expect to interact with other elements of the [Pattern Lab Ecosystem](#ecosystem).

### Direct Consumption

As of Pattern Lab Node 3.X, `patternlab-node` can run standalone, without the need for task runners like gulp or grunt.

`npm install patternlab-node`

See [Usage](#Usage) for more information.

### Editions

For users wanting a more pre-packaged experience several editions are available.

* [Pattern Lab/Node: Gulp Edition](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-gulp) contains info how to get started within a Gulp task running environment.
* [Pattern Lab/Node: Grunt Edition](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node-grunt) contains info how to get started within a Grunt task running environment.
* [Pattern Lab/Node: Vanilla Edition](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-node) contains info how to get started within a pure node environment.
* [Pattern Lab/Node: Webpack Edition](https://github.com/Comcast/patternlab-edition-node-webpack) contains info how to get started within a webpack environment.
  >Thanks to the team at Comcast for open-sourcing this stellar work!

## Ecosystem

![Pattern Lab Ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/assets/pattern-lab-2-image_18-large-opt.png)

Core, and Editions, are part of the [Pattern Lab Ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html). With this architecture, we encourage people to write and maintain their own Editions, Starterkits, and even PatternEngines.

## Usage

`patternlab-node` can be required within any Node environment, taking in a configuration file at instantiation.

``` javascript

const config = require('./patternlab-config.json');
const patternlab = require('patternlab-node')(config);


// build, optionally watching or choosing incremental builds
patternlab.build({
  cleanPublic: true,
  watch: true
});

// or build, watch, and then self-host
patternlab.serve({
  cleanPublic: true
});

```

* Read more about [configuration](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Configuration) via `patternlab-config.json`.

* Read more about the rest of [api](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Public-API), and already implemented for you within [Editions](#editions).

* A full-featured [command line interface](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node-cli) is also available courtesy of [@raphaelokon](https://github.com/raphaelokon).


### Events

Many [events](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Creating-Plugins#events) are emitted during Pattern Lab operations, originally built to support plugins. Below is a sample, allowing users to be informed of asset or pattern changes.

``` javascript

patternlab.serve(...);

patternlab.events.on('patternlab-asset-change', (data) => {
  console.log(data); // {file: 'path/to/file.css', dest: 'path/to/destination'}
});

patternlab.events.on('patternlab-pattern-change', (data) => {
  console.log(data); // {file: 'path/to/file.ext'}
});

patternlab.events.on('patternlab-global-change', (data) => {
  console.log(data); // {file: 'path/to/file.ext'}
});

```

## Development Installation / Workflow

If you are interested in [contributing to Pattern Lab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), it's suggested to install an Edition of your choice and then run a local copy of this repository via [`npm link`](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/link).

``` bash
mkdir /patternlab-node
cd /patternlab-node
git clone https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node.git
npm install
npm link
cd location/of/editionOrSourceAndConfig
npm link patternlab-node
```

The above is a bit verbose, but illustrates:

1. how to clone this repository to an arbitrary location
2. install all dependencies (run `npm install --dev` if your NODE_ENV is production for some reason)
3. setup the `npm link` to your local copy
4. use the local copy of patternlab-node in your edition / working directory

> Make sure to change to whichever branch you intend to hack on or test within your cloned repository, such as `dev` or `bugfix/fixes-broken-unittest`
