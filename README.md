# Pattern Lab

This monorepo contains the core of Pattern Lab / Node and all related engines, UI kits, plugins and utilities. Pattern Lab helps you and your team build thoughtful, pattern-driven user interfaces using atomic design principles.

If you'd like to see what a front-end project built with Pattern Lab looks like, check out this [online demo of Pattern Lab output](http://demo.patternlab.io/).

## Using Pattern Lab

Refer to the [core usage guidelines](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/master/packages/core/README.md#usage)

### Installation

As of Pattern Lab Node 3.0.0, installation of [Editions](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html) is accomplished via the command line interface.

The below assumes a new directory and project is required. This is likely what you want to do if starting from scratch. You could also run this within an existing project. The CLI will ask you for the installation location.

1. Open a terminal window and following along below:
    ```bash
    mkdir new-project
    cd new-project
    npm create pattern-lab
    ```
    > If you get an error stating that `npx` is not installed, ensure you are on `npm 5.2.0` or later by running `npm -v` or install it globally with `npm install -g npx`. [Learn more about npx.](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)
1. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose your Edition and a Starterkit should you want one.
  - If you chose `edition-node`, new commands in the "scripts" will be added in your `package.json`.
  - If you chose `edition-node-gulp`, a `gulpfile.js` will be added to your project.

  > Notice that `@pattern-lab/cli` was installed as a depdendency. Learn how to further [use the cli in your own project](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/dev/packages/cli/readme.md#configuring-your-project-to-use-the-cli).


## Ecosystem

![Pattern Lab Ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/assets/pattern-lab-2-image_18-large-opt.png)

Core, and Editions, are part of the [Pattern Lab Ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html). With this architecture, we encourage people to write and maintain their own Editions, Starterkits, and even PatternEngines.

## Changelog
