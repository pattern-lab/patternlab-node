## First Steps with Horizon's Patternlab

$ npm i
$ npm start serve

## How to deploy?
Deployments are done automatically each time that you commit and push your changes!
Therefore be really careful before you decide to push some changes into the master branch (they go live automatically), and work on branches, if possible.
