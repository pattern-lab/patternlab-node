This is the default location to place meta files, otherwise known a pattern's header and footer.

Pattern Lab builds each pattern while prepending and appending the header and footer. Read more about [pattern headers and footers](https://patternlab.io/docs/modifying-the-pattern-header-and-footer/).

If you wish to rename this directory, make sure you update the `paths.source.meta` property within `patternlab-config.json`.
