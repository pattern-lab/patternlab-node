## The Mustache PatternEngine for Pattern Lab / Node

This one should be included by default with [Pattern Lab Node Core](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/dev/packages/core) and consumed by [Node Editions](https://github.com/pattern-lab?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=edition-node).

If it's missing from your project for any reason, `npm install @pattern-lab/engine-mustache` should do the trick.
