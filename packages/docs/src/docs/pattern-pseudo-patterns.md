Pseudo-patterns give developers and designers the ability to quickly build multiple unique variants of an existing pattern. This feature is especially useful when developing template- and page-style patterns or showing the states of other patterns.

## The Pseudo-Pattern File Naming Convention

Pseudo-patterns are similar to [pattern-specific JSON files](/docs/creating-pattern-specific-values/) but are hinted in such a way that a developer can build a variant of an existing pattern. The basic syntax:

    patternName~pseudo-pattern-name.json

The tilde (`~`) and `.json` file extension are the hints that Pattern Lab uses to determine that this is a pseudo-pattern. The `patternName` tells Pattern Lab which existing pattern it should use when rendering the pseudo-pattern. The JSON file itself works exactly like the [pattern-specific JSON file](/docs/creating-pattern-specific-values/). It has the added benefit that the pseudo-pattern will also inherit any values from the existing pattern's pattern-specific JSON file.

## The Pseudo-Pattern File Data

By default, arrays in pseudo-pattern data will be merged with the base pattern's array data on an index basis, effectively creating an array having as many entries as the larger of the two, with the indices declared in the variant replacing the first n of the parent, while keeping the rest. Declaring a larger array in the variant results in only using the variant array. To override this behavior globally you can set the parameter `patternMergeVariantArrays` in your `patternlab-config.json` to `false`. Arrays will then be overwritten and you will only have the variant's array data left.

```json
"patternMergeVariantArrays": false
```

From a navigation and naming perspective `patternName` and `pseudoPatternName` will be combined.

## Adding Pseudo-Patterns to Your Project

Adding a pseudo-pattern is as simple as naming it correctly and following the [pattern-specific JSON file](/docs/creating-pattern-specific-values/) instructions for organizing its content. Let's look at a simple example where we want to show an emergency notification on our homepage Mustache template. Our `templates/` directory might look like this:

    article.mustache
    blog.mustache
    homepage.mustache

Our `homepage.mustache` template might look like this:

```html
{% raw %}
<div id="main-container">
	{{# emergency }}
	<div class="emergency">Oh Noes! Emergency!</div>
	{{/ emergency }} { ...a bunch of other content... }
</div>
{% endraw %}
```

If our `_data.json` file doesn't give a value for `emergency` that section will never show up when `homepage.mustache` is rendered. Obviously we'd need to show _both_ the regular and emergency states of the homepage but we don't want to duplicate the entire `homepage.mustache` template. That would be a maintenance nightmare. So let's add our pseudo-pattern:

```
article.mustache
blog.mustache
homepage.mustache
homepage~emergency.json
```

In our pseudo-pattern, `homepage~emergency.json`, we add our `emergency` attribute:

```javascript
{% raw %}{
    "emergency": true
}{% endraw %}
```

Now when we generate our site we'll have our homepage template rendered twice. Once as the regular template and once as a pseudo-pattern showing the emergency section. Note that the pseudo-pattern will show up in our navigation as `Homepage Emergency`.

## Using Pseudo-Patterns as Pattern Includes

By default, pseudo-patterns **cannot** be used as pattern includes. The data included in the pseudo-pattern, the bit that actually controls the magic, cannot be accessed when rendering the pattern include.
