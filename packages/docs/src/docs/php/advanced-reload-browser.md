An auto-reload service was built into Pattern Lab 1. With Pattern Lab 2 this feature has been turned into the [Auto-Reload Plugin](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-reload). To install this plugin do the following:

1. In a terminal window navigate to the root of your project
2. Type `composer require pattern-lab/plugin-reload`

The Auto-Reload Plugin is automatically enabled when you install it. You can always [disable the plugin](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-reload#disabling-the-plugin) if you need to.

This service is enabled when using the `--watch` or `--server --with-watch` commands. Learn more about [watching for changes](/docs/advanced-auto-regenerate.html).
