The PHP version of Pattern Lab is being deprecated in favor of a new unified Pattern Lab core. The PHP docs for this topic can be viewed here.

The current version of PL's website includes full docs for PHP. The new version of PL runs exclusively through Node, but for PHP projects will compile PHP with a PHP renderer.
