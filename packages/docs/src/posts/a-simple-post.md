A simple post to demonstrate how a normal blog post looks on Hylia. Content is all set in the “Body” field as markdown and Eleventy transforms it into a proper HTML post. You can also edit the markdown file directly if you prefer not to use the CMS.

If you want to make an image bleed-out, add a title attribute to it and the front-end will automatically wrap it in a `<figure>` tag for you.

You can also add videos to posts from YouTube or Vimeo (or wherever, really) and the front-end will also make those bleed-out for you too.

Finally, how about a `<blockquote>`? 

> Quotes will take a slightly different style to normal body text and look fancy.

Hopefully, this has demonstrated how simple it is to make a nice looking blog with Hylia.
