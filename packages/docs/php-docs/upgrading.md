Pattern Lab 2 uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) to manage project dependencies. To upgrade an edition based on Pattern Lab 2 do the following:

1. In a terminal window navigate to the root of your project
2. Type `composer update`

During the upgrade process Pattern Lab 2 will move or add any files that are required for the new version to work. It will also update your configuration as appropriate. If you don't have Composer installed please [follow the directions for installing Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) that are available on the Composer website. We recommend you [install it globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).

## Upgrading Pattern Lab 1 to Pattern Lab 2

Pattern Lab 2 was a complete rewrite and reorganization of Pattern Lab 1. [Learn about the changes](/docs/changes-1-to-2.html). To upgrade do the following:

1. [Download](http://patternlab.io/download.html) the PHP edition that matches your needs

If you chose a Mustache-based edition do the following:

1. Copy `./source` from your old project to your new edition
2. Copy `./source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_00-head.mustache` to `./source/_meta/_00-head.mustache`
3. Copy `./source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_01-foot.mustache` to `./source/_meta/_00-foot.mustache` (you can then delete `source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/` directory)
4. In `./source/_meta/_00-head.mustache`, replace `{% raw %}{% pattern-lab-head %}{% endraw %}` with `{% raw %}{{{ patternLabHead }}}{% endraw %}`
5. In `./source/_meta/_00-foot.mustache` replace `{% raw %}{% pattern-lab-foot %}{% endraw %}` with `{% raw %}{{{ patternLabFoot }}}{% endraw %}`
6. Copy `./source/_data/annotations.js` to `./source/_annotations/annotations.js`
7. Remove the underscore in front of the JSON files in `source/data` (i.e. `data.json` not `_data.json`).



If you chose another version do the above and convert the templates as appropriate.
