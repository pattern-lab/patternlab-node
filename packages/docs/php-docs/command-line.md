## A Special Note About Windows

To access the command prompt on Windows you can [follow the directions from Microsoft](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/open-a-command-prompt-window). After getting to the command prompt type the following to make sure you have PHP installed:

    php -v

If you get an error and know that you've installed PHP you may need to [update your path variable so Windows can find PHP](http://willj.co/2012/10/run-wamp-php-windows-7-command-line/).
