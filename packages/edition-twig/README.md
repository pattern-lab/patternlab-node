## Working on Pattern Lab's UI Locally

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Run the following in the root of the Pattern Lab repo:

```
yarn run setup
```

### Step 2

Finally, go back into this folder, `cd packages/edition-twig`, and start up the local dev server which watches UIKit and the local Pattern Lab instance for changes, live reloads, etc by running `yarn dev`
