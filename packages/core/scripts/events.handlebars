# Pattern Lab Node Events

[![Join the chat at Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/pattern-lab/node.svg)](https://gitter.im/pattern-lab/node)

Pattern Lab emits numerous events during the [build](../docs/) process. Some uses of events:

* Core uses `patternlab-pattern-change` events when watching for changes in order to trigger another build
* Plugins such as [plugin-tab](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/plugin-tab) can use an event like `patternlab-pattern-write-end` to define additional code tabs to the pattern viewer / modal

Learn more about [Creating Plugins](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/wiki/Creating-Plugins).
