This is the default location to place global data files.

Pattern Lab uses data defined here as the global fallback if a template does not provide its own data. Read more about [data](https://patternlab.io/docs/overview-of-data/).

If you wish to rename this directory, make sure you update the `paths.source.data` property within `patternlab-config.json`.
