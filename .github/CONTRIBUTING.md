# Contributing to Pattern Lab Node

If you'd like to contribute to Pattern Lab Node, please do so! There is always a lot of ground to cover and something for your wheelhouse.

No pull request is too small. Check out any [help wanted ðŸ†˜](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted+%3Asos%3A%22) or [good first issues ðŸŽ“](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue+%3Amortar_board%3A%22) as a good way to get your feet wet, or add some more unit tests.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you'll need Node installed. Managing Node with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is recommended. Once installed, you can target the version of Node we specify within the [`.nvmrc`](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/blob/master/.nvmrc) file.

```sh
nvm install <<version>>
nvm use <<version>>
```

## Developing Locally

The best way to make changes to the Pattern Lab Node core and test them is through an edition.

* Fork this repository on Github.
* `yarn install && yarn run bootstrap`
* Create a new branch in your fork and push your changes in that fork.
* `cd packages/edition-node`
* Test your changes with the edition's api

### Cold start testing

To ensure that developers can bootstrap the repo from a fresh clone, do this in your working copy:

```sh
git reset --hard && git clean -dfx && yarn install && yarn run bootstrap
```

This ensures that any changes you've made will still result in a clean and functional developer experience. **Note**: be sure you've committed any outstanding work before doing this -- it will blow away whatever's still outstanding, including anything staged but not commited.

## Guidelines

* _ALWAYS_ submit pull requests against the [dev branch](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/dev). If this does not occur, we will first, try to redirect you gently, second, attempt to redirect the target branch myself, thirdly, port over your contribution manually if time allows, and/or lastly, close your pull request. If you have a major feature to stabilize over time, ping @pattern-lab/trusted-committers via an issue about making a dedicated `feature-branch`
* Keep your pull requests concise and limited to **ONE** substantive change at a time. This makes reviewing and testing so much easier.
* If it takes you considerable time to finish your work, submit a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). This is Github's way to indicate work in progress but allows for feedback.
* Commits should reference the issue you are adressing. For any Pull Request that you send, use the template provided.
* Commits are best formatted using the [conventional commits pattern](https://conventionalcommits.org/).
* If you can, add some unit tests using the existing patterns in the `.packages/core/test` directory
* Large enhancements should begin with opening an issue. This will result in a more systematic way for us to review your contribution and determine if a [specifcation discussion](https://github.com/pattern-lab/the-spec/issues) needs to occur.
* Mention the issue number in commits, so anyone can see to which issue your changes belong to. For instance:
  * `fix(get): Resolve patterns correctly`
  * `feat(version): Add ability to ask for version statically`

## Coding style

Formatting is automated via [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), setup to run on precommit. We suggest [editor integration](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html) for this and for eslint. Prettier is further configured within `.prettierrc`. Eslint validates syntax and usage that Prettier doesn't handle. Configuration for both is found within the `.eslintrc.json` file.

The `.editorconfig` controls spaces / tabs within supported editors. Check out their [site](http://editorconfig.org/).

## Tests

Add unit and integration tests if you can. It's always nice if our code coverage improves bit by bit (literally!). We are using [Node Tap](http://www.node-tap.org/) as test framework and [Rewire](https://github.com/jhnns/rewire) for mocking things like file system access.

## Branching Scheme

![branching scheme](branching-scheme.png) Currently Pattern Lab has the following branches:

* **master** contains the latext stable, released version</dd>
* **dev**: for development. _Target pull requests against this branch._
* **feature-branches** for larger changes. Allows merging all changes into both `dev` easily.
* **long running branches** for changes that involve major changes to the code, architecture and take a lot of time (i.e. making Pattern Lab async)

New features are typically cut off of `dev` branch. When `dev` is stable cut releases by merging `dev` to `master` and creating a release tag.
